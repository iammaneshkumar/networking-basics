# What is data transmission?

Data transmission refers to the process of transferring the data between two or more digital devices in analog or digital format. This data is transferred in the form of bits.

## Types of data transmission -

1. **Parallel data transmission** - Parallel data transmission sends multiple data bits at the same time over multiple channels.

### Advantages of prallel data transmissio

- Data is send at the one same time to the receiver

### Disadvantages of parallel data transmission

- More expensive due to multiple chanells arrangement

**- Used within short distance -**

2. **Serial data transmission** - Serial data transmission sends data bits one after another over a single channel.

### Advantages of serial data transmission

- Low cost

### Disadvantages of serial data transmission

- Time taking for transmission

**- Used in long distance data sharing -**

	# Types of serial data transmission
	
	1. **Synchronous** - In synchronous data transmission, a lot of data is sent in a block. Each block has many characters.
	
	2. **Ascnchronous** - In aysnchronous transmission, only one character is sent at a time. Whether that a character is number or alphabet. It uses **start** and **stop** bits for transferring data.
