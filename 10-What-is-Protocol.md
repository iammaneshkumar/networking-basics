# What is Protocol

Protocol is a **set of rules* which are used in digital communication to connect network devices and exchange information between them.

## Types of Protocol

- **TCP/IP** - TPC stand for Transmission control protocol where as IP stands for internet protocol. TCP is used to transfer data over the internet. It divides the data into small packets and sends it to the destination through the network. while IP is used for addressing through which data reahces the final destination.

- **HTTP** - HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol) is an application protocol that is used in the address bar of web browser before WWW. Where we search anything in the address bar of browser so it brings that website in front of us.

- **FTP** - FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is used to transfer the file from server to client machine. It uses the TCP/IP protocol to enable data tranfer.

- **SMTP** - SMTP stand for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is used to send and receive the emails in the network. There are two more protocol uses with SMTP (POP and IMAP), all these protocols work with the help of TCP/IP.

- **POP** - POP stands for Post office protocol. It is a mail box which is actually a message access protocol through which a user can fetch the email from the server. POP protocol works up on TCP/IP protocol and helps the SMTP protocol from end to end communication.

- **IMAP** - IMAP stands for Internet Mail Access Protocol. It is also a mail box which is actually an improved version of POP. By using IMAP, the main advantage is we can retrive our deletd email from the server.

- **PPP** - PPP stand for Point to Point Protocol. It is used to transfer data between two directly connected devices. 

- **UPP** - UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is an unreliable and connection less protocol so, in order to send the data from one machine to another machine we did not establish any connection in compare to TCP/IP protocol. It is used to transfer the data in a short distance.
