### First Computer Network- ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

## Characteristics of Computer Network

- Resource sharing
- Communication speed
- Backup
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Security
- Software and Hardware sharing

## Network devices:-

HUB, Switch, Bridge, gateway, modem, router, repeater etc.

## Network types

1. PAN - Personal area network : used for personal use (like Home etc) within less than 10 meter of range
2. LAN - Local area network : Used for an office (building) ranges upto 150 Meter

- backup and storage

## Disadvanatges of networking
- Network device required
- Virus attack
- Required handler to handle it
- High speed internet cost
- Server required (Cloud or local)


## Difference among LAN, MAN and WAN

| LAN | MAN | WAN |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Lan stands for local area network | MAN stands for Metropolitan area network | WAN stands for wide area network |
| Is is used for building like offices | Is is used for city like Delhi | It is used for Countries |
| Transmission speed of data is high | Transmission speed of data is average | Transmission speed i low |
| Ranges upto 150 Meter | Ranges from 5 to 50 KM | Not fixed |
| Ownership is private | Ownership is Private or Public | WAN also Public or Private |
| Easy to maintain | Difficult to maintain than LAN | Very difficult to maintain than both LAN and MAN |
| Setup cost or error rate is low | Average Setup cost and error rate | High setup cost and error rate than LAN and MAN |
