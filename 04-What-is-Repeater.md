# What is Repeater?

Repeater is a network device through we can boostup the weak signals.
When the signal in the network, after travelling some distance the intensity of the signal becomes low.
In order to regenerate the weak signal we should use the Repeater device.

**Note -** It is used in wired and wireless

## Advantages of Repeater

1. It is used to regenerate the weak signal.
2. It is cheapter than other network device.
3. Repeater has the ability to extend the length of the singal.
4. Increase and maintain the signal performance.

## Disadvantages of Repeater

1. It required the number of repeaters after some distances.
2. Repeaters also unable to connect dis-similar type of network.
3. They can't the reduce network traffic.
